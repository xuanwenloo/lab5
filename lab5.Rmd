# Load accident.csv file

```

# Part one: Accident data

1. Are there some days of the week where more accidents happen than on others (use variable DAY_WEEK)?

2. What time of the day do accidents happen (use variable HOUR)?

3. What is the number of accidents with at least one drunk driver (use variable DRUNK_DR)?

# Part two: Connecting data

1. Connect to the person table. Identify drivers (PER_TYP == 1, see fars manual ) and subset on them.

2. Join accident and driver table (work out which variable(s) to use)

3. Tally the number of accidents by day of the week (DAY_WEEK), hour of the day (HOUR) and gender (SEX). Visualize the results!
